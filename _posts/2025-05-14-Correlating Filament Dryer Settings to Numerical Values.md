The goal of this experiment is to correlate the setting labels on the EnCuerdas single-spool filament dryer to actual numerical temperature values.

## Procedure
1. Fix thermocouple about 3cm into filament dryer through front filament hole. Use tape to secure. 
2. Remove filament from dryer.
3. Repeat for each setting:
	1. Adjust temperature in predefined increments (the borders between settings) and wait for temperature to stabilize.
	2. Record stabilized temperature.
## Equipment
- EnCuerdas single-spool filament dryer
	- Model #: Easdry 2305 120V
- AstroAI multimeter 
	- Model #: DM6000AR
	- Temperature not calibrated.
- Standard AstroAI thermocouple
- 3M Painter's Tape

## Results

| Setting | T (C) |
| ------- | ----- |
| Ambient | 20    |
| 0       | 39    |
| 1       | 45    |
| 2       | 48    |
| 3       | 53    |
| 4       | 60    |
| 5       | 66    |
| 6       | 72    |
| 7       | 76    |
## Conclusion
I sharpie’d on the temperature readings in their appropriate spots. Now, I’ll be able to dry at higher temps without fear of melting any filament.
